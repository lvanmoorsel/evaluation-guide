## 1 How Is Mendix Different?

Mendix is the fastest and easiest platform to build and continuously improve Mobile and Web apps that enable innovation at web scale. It is the only low-code rapid application platform for development and delivery that provides a comprehensive, integrated set of tools for the entire app lifecycle – from ideation and development through deployment and operation.

This section zooms in on the main aspects why Mendix is different compared to others in the low code market.

## 2 What Is Mendix's History of Delivering Innovation?

Innovation happens when people with ideas and technology come together. The culture of innovation has lived within Mendix from the day that the company was started, resulting in a long list of industry-first innovations. Here is just a glimpse of these industry-first innovations that our customers have been able to leverage: App Store (2010), Full Application Lifecycle Management support (2012), 1-click Cloud Deploy (2013), Platform API (2013), Mobile support (2014), Sandboxes/Free cloud environments (2014), Cloud Foundry support (2014), Offline Mobile support (2015), Model Share (2015), Model API & SDK (2015), Horizontal scalability (2015), Cloud-native low-code app runtime (2017), High-control and scalable cloud (2017), low-code and no-code collaboration via Web Modeler (2017), adopting Docker and Kubernetes (2017) and the first low code platform to support AI-assisted development (2018).

We are committed to keeping our platform up-to-date with the latest technologies so our customers can deliver differentiated applications in record time.

## 3 How Does Mendix Focus on Adding Business Value?

Delivering applications quickly is a key reason for adopting a low code platform, but to achieve true agility and scale with application development, Mendix marries speed with collaboration and control. Mendix brings business and IT together with by providing a common language between both worlds. 

Mendix involves the business users across the application lifecycle from ideation and continuous feedback, to direct participation in development with visual models. The next section zooms in on how business users, without any coding experience, can build apps with Mendix.


## 4 How Does Mendix Provide Both Low Code & No Code in a Single Platform?

Both no-code and low-code tools use visual, model-driven development concepts to speed up and transform application development.

No-code tools (as the name suggests) enable users to build apps without writing any code. The target audience for this capability consists of business analysts, business developers, and citizen developers – users with no or very little experience in software development. Low-code tools add another dimension, which is the ability to extend application models with custom code, such as Java extensions. This makes low-code tools appealing to a far wider range of developers with any level of software development experience.

In a way, the "low-code" and "no-code" labels can be misleading. At Mendix, we think the main distinction is found in the types of people using these tools.

Organizations wanting to harness the power of both groups should look for a rapid application development platform that is appealing to both business developers and professional developers. Each user should feel comfortable and empowered to build apps themselves. But the real value is contained in enabling teams of developers from both business and IT with mixed experience levels to collaborate on a single platform and be focused on achieving the same goal – building apps that solve real business problems with unprecedented speed and out-of-the box control.

The Mendix Platform contains the Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler, which are visual modeling environments that combine to deliver an integrated and model-driven app development experience across the full continuum of users. What is more, these modeling environments are integrated with the Mendix Development Portal as the backbone for collaborative modeling.

## 5 How Does Mendix Support Full Application Lifecycle Management?

The Mendix platform supports the rapid delivery of Applications through an integrated set of tools designed to cover the full Application Lifecycle, starting with business requirements capture, teams can create a backlog of user stories, sprint and release plans. Mendix provides an API to integrate with third-party tools, should you already have the technology for requirements management. Once created developers use the Web and Desktop modeling environments to rapidly build and iterate over the current sprints user stories, continuously merging models, shipping revisions for automated testing, and refactoring feedback from the built-in feedback mechanism and collaboration features inside the platform.  

All contributing parties from the Product Owner to the Testing teams are continuously connected to changes and updates in the delivery cycle, via real-time interactive data feeds connected to assets in the model, built-in chat and collaboration features, and visual models that enable business users to contribute early and often around design and logic decisions. 

## 6  What Does the Mendix Cloud-Native Architecture Look Like?

The Mendix cloud-native architecture enables you to scale your applications and nodes while supporting the speed and flexibility required to deliver new functionality. Built-in Agility and DevOps combine with our Cloud-Foundry (PaaS) support to allow small cross-functional teams to deploy highly portable, microservices based applications in containers.

## 7 What Strategic Partnerships Has Mendix Developed?

Mendix has strategic partnerships with both SAP and IBM.

SAP has adopted the Mendix Platform as their own rapid application development platform for extending their solutions. The SAP Solution Extension partnership means you can not only purchase Mendix from SAP directly, but quickly and easily integrate Mendix with SAP in a variety of ways, take advantage of a single point of contact for support, and build Mendix apps on top of SAP.

Mendix is the standard low-code development platform to be used on top of IBM Cloud. This means you can utilize IBM as a single contact for using Mendix on IBM Cloud.
