## 1 Why was Mendix founded? {#vision}

The founders of Mendix learned it the hard way: delivering software that fulfills business needs is extremely hard and fails more often than it succeeds. Mendix was founded on the belief that software development could only be significantly improved if there was a paradigm shift. And thatâ€™s exactly what Mendix introduced.

Rewind the clock to the early 2000s. One of the founders of Mendix (Roald) is developing software as a free-lance developer. Time and time again he finds that, despite long hours of work and all the best intentions, the customer (often: the business) isn't happy with the result at all. Even long functional requirement documents do not help solve this problem. The result: a frustrated customer, let alone a frustrated and increasingly demotivated developer. 

Why could this happen? It doesn't take long for Roald to realize that apparently he doesn't understand the business after all, despite lengthy documents and long requirements sessions. Many implicit assumptions exist on both sides about how the software will work or the way it will look. And even if there is perceived alignment, the next day the customer's requirements will change, consciously of unconsciously, and the whole process is back at square one. Why can't the business simply make up their minds on what they want? Determined to get to the root of this problem, Roald gets an MBA. It is during his studies that he gets a full view on how large and how fundamental the problem actually is. In essence: there is an inherent gap between business and IT in any organization, and unless the gap is bridged, there is very little chance any software project will be remotely successful. 

As a next step, Roald starts using visual tools such as flow charts, user interface mockups and process mappings in the requirements discovery and software design phase. This allows the business to validate his interpretation of their requirements before any coding happens. Although a very valuable step forward, it leaves Roald with three additional problems. One: once validated, the actual coding becomes far less interesting, since the majority of thought process has happened during the requirements and design phase. Programming now often involves many repetitive tassk which in the end does not make any developer happy. Two: still, requirements often have to be reverse engineered by a developer from the comments the business stakeholders make. Three: it is becoming harder to keep up-to-date with the repidly evolving number of programming tools and languages across the spectrum. It is virtuallly impossible for a single developer to be proficient in back-end tooling, front-end tooling, database tooling and the different operating systems at the same time. This makes developers highly dependent on other people with specific skills which adds significant lead time to the software development project.




REMOVE/REPLACE:

Mendix is fundamentally changing how software is created. With the current generation of the Mendix Platform, business applications can be created 10 times faster in close collaboration with (or even wholly owned by) the business while IT is in control.

Mendix was founded with a two-point mission that still holds true today:

* To bridge the business-IT gap and enable organizations with a whole new way to innovate and differentiate with apps
* Build a company that will attract, develop, excite and retain exceptional people

And thus Mendix came into creation. The name "Mendix" is derived from the verb *to mend*, which means to repair anything that is broken, torn, defaced, or the like.

Mendix is here to mend the relationship between business and IT.
