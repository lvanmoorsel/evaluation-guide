## 1 Why Mendix? {#vision}

The founders of Mendix learned it the hard way: delivering software that fulfills business needs is extremely hard and fails more often than it succeeds. Mendix was founded on the belief that software development could only be significantly improved if there was a paradigm shift. And thatâ€™s exactly what Mendix introduced.

Mendix is fundamentally changing how software is created. With the current generation of the Mendix Platform, business applications can be created 10 times faster in close collaboration with (or even wholly owned by) the business while IT is in control.

Mendix was founded with a two-point mission that still holds true today:

* To bridge the business-IT gap and enable organizations with a whole new way to innovate and differentiate with apps
* Build a company that will attract, develop, excite and retain exceptional people

And thus Mendix came into creation. The name "Mendix" is derived from the verb *to mend*, which means to repair anything that is broken, torn, defaced, or the like.

Mendix is here to mend the relationship between business and IT.
