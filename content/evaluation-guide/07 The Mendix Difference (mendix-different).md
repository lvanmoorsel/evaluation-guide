## 1 How Is Mendix Different?

Mendix is the fastest and easiest platform to build and continuously improve Mobile and Web apps that enable innovation at web scale. It is the only application platform that provides a comprehensive, integrated set of tools for the entire app lifecycle, from ideation and development through deployment and operation.

This section zooms in on the main aspects why Mendix is different compared to others in the low code market.

**Focus on business value**

We focus on adding business true value first. Mendix brings business and IT together with a creating a common language between both worlds. Mendix involves the business in the process from a requirements gathering and feedback perspective, as well as from a development perspective. The next section zooms in on how business users without any conding experience can build apps with Mendix.

**Collaboration**

The talent gap for software development is only widening. Teaching more people to program will not solve this, as the gap is exponentially growing. So, we need to involve a much broader audience in software development. They key to faster and better software delivery is collaboration. The Mendix Platform brings the people with ideas together with the people with the technical aptitude to execute those ideas.

**Full Application Lifecycle Management support**

The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to development, deployment, test and the ongoing management of your application portfolio in the cloud or on premises.

**Strategic Partnerships**

Mendix has strategic partnerships with both SAP and IBM.

SAP has adopted the Mendix Platform as their own rapid application development platform for extending their solutions. The SAP Solution Extension partnership means you can not only purchase Mendix from SAP directly, but integrate Mendix with SAP in a variety of ways, take advantage of a single point of contact for support, and build Mendix apps on top of SAP.

Mendix is the standard low-code development platform to be used on top of IBM Cloud. This means you can utilize IBM as a single contact for using Mendix on IBM Cloud.

**Industry first**

Innovation happens when people with ideas and technology come together. The culture of innovation lives within Mendix from the day that the company is started, resulting in long list of industry-first innovations. Here just a grap of these industry-first innovations as a Low Code platform: App Store (2010), Full Application Lifecycle Management support (2012), 1-click Cloud Deploy (2013), Platform API (2013), Mobile support (2014), Sandboxes/Free cloud environments (2014), Cloud Foundry support (2014), Offline Mobile support (2015), Model Share (2015), Model API & SDK (2015), Horizontal scalability (2015), Cloud-native low-code app runtime (2017), High-control and scalable cloud (2017), low-code and no-code collaboration via Web Modeler (2017) and adopting Kubernetes (2017).

## 2 Low Code and No Code in a Single Platform

Both no-code and low-code tools use visual, model-driven development concepts to speed up and transform application development.

No-code tools (as the name suggests) enable users to build apps without writing any code. Their target audience consists of business analysts, business developers, and citizen developers – users with no or very little experience in software development. Low-code tools add another dimension, which is the ability to extend application models with custom code, such as Java extensions. This makes low-code tools appealing to a far wider range of developers with any level of software development experience.

In a way, the "low-code" and "no-code" labels can be misleading. Is the difference whether people need to code or not? At Mendix, we think the main distinction is found in the types of people using these tools.

Organizations wanting to harness the power of both groups should look for a rapid application development platform that is appealing to both business developers and professional developers. Each user should feel comfortable and empowered to build apps themselves. But the real value is contained in enabling teams of developers from both business and IT with mixed experience levels to collaborate on a single platform and be focused on achieving the same goal – building apps that solve real business problems with unprecedented speed and out-of-the box control.

The Mendix Platform contains the Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler, which are visual modeling environments that combine to deliver an integrated and model-driven app development experience across the full continuum of users. What is more, these modeling environments are integrated with the Mendix Development Portal as the backbone for collaborative modeling.
