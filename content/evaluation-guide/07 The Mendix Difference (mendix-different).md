## 2 Low Code and No Code in a Single Platform

Both no-code and low-code tools use visual, model-driven development concepts to speed up and transform application development.

No-code tools (as the name suggests) enable users to build apps without writing any code. Their target audience consists of business analysts, business developers, and citizen developers – users with no or very little experience in software development. Low-code tools add another dimension, which is the ability to extend application models with custom code, such as Java extensions. This makes low-code tools appealing to a far wider range of developers with any level of software development experience.

In a way, the "low-code" and "no-code" labels can be misleading. Is the difference whether people need to code or not? At Mendix, we think the main distinction is found in the types of people using these tools.

Organizations wanting to harness the power of both groups should look for a rapid application development platform that is appealing to both business developers and professional developers. Each user should feel comfortable and empowered to build apps themselves. But the real value is contained in enabling teams of developers from both business and IT with mixed experience levels to collaborate on a single platform and be focused on achieving the same goal – building apps that solve real business problems with unprecedented speed and out-of-the box control.

The Mendix Platform contains the Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler, which are visual modeling environments that combine to deliver an integrated and model-driven app development experience across the full continuum of users. What is more, these modeling environments are integrated with the Mendix Development Portal as the backbone for collaborative modeling.
