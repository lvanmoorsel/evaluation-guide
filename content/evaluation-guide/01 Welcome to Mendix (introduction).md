The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to development, deployment, and the ongoing management of your application portfolio in the cloud or on premises.

Mendix offers both no-code (collaborative visual modeling) and low-code (highly extensible and integrated, collaborative tooling to support cross-functional teams) solutions. Business domain experts such as analysts and citizen developers can work alongside expert developers to achieve much greater levels of business agility and accelerated delivery. The Mendix Platform's cloud-native architecture and automation tools support the deployment, management, and monitoring of highly available enterprise-grade applications. 

Based on our three core principles of speed, collaboration, and control, Mendix offers a complete platform for your enterprise application delivery needs.

## Why was Mendix founded?

The founders of Mendix learned it the hard way: delivering software that fulfills business needs is extremely hard and fails more often than it succeeds. Mendix was founded on the belief that software development could only be significantly improved if there was a paradigm shift. And thatâ€™s exactly what Mendix introduced.

## What Is the Mendix Vision? {#vision}

In a world where software is the lifeblood of every company, our vision is to empower people with diverse skills and backgrounds to collaborate successfully and create better software that delivers true business value. Mendix can accomplish this more quickly and at a significantly lower cost than ever before.

The Mendix Platform brings together the people with ideas and the people with the technical aptitude to execute in order to create a powerful force for change, which we believe is necessary to compete and survive in this software-driven world.

## How Does Mendix Optimize the Collaboration Between Business & IT? {#optimize-collaboration}

To achieve the high levels of agility and continuous interactions required to collaborate effectively across multi-disciplinary teams, the Mendix Platform combines the following key concepts:

* Abstraction through visual model-driven development tools
* Automation via continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)
* Intelligent assisted development with a fully integrated feed that maps every interaction across the application lifecycle to a central dashboard

Project team members are connected instantly and interactively to changes and updates about new requirements, software revisions, updates, and shipments, including test results and feedback loops from end-users. This live feed becomes the backbone for the collaborative process, while visual models and drag-and-drop WYSYWG editors lower the barrier to entry for business users to participate in the app development process.
