## 1 How Can I Quickstart My App Development Project? {#starter-apps}

The Mendix Platform provides several starter apps as part of the onboarding process for [creating new applications](#can-i-build).

Starter apps are complete app frameworks that can be used as a starting point when building a new app on the Mendix Platform. Starter apps provide the scaffolding required to massively accelerate app development, as they include basic design patterns such as branding, design assets, page templates, navigation, and security models.

You can also upload your own starter apps to your [Private App Store](https://docs.mendix.com/community/app-store/share-app-store-content#private-app-store) to make them available as starting points for your whole organization. This way, they can be used to create the root model of all new apps. In addition to basic design patterns, they will often include complete functional building blocks, such as user onboarding workflows, integration frameworks, document management, business rules, and processes.

## 3 Where Do I Start with the Mendix Platform? {#where-do-i-start}

Mendix's rapidly growing community consists of a wide range of people, from citizen developers and business analysts who can build Mendix apps without any coding experience, to hardcore developers who build all kinds of apps and extend the Mendix Platform with custom code.

In order to onboard this variety of users, Mendix provides a [guided product introduction tour](#tailored-guidance) based on the user profile and preferences. Next to that, Mendix users can use two Mendix Platform IDEs (the [Web Modeler](../app-lifecycle/app-development#web-modeler) and [Desktop Modeler](../app-lifecycle/app-development#desktop-modeler)) as well as [external IDE's](../enterprise-capabilities/extensibility#external-ides) that integrate with Mendix. The Web Modeler can be used as a no-code development IDE for citizen developers. In the Desktop Modeler, you can build complex integrations and extend your app with custom code and more advanced features. This low-code development IDE enables everyone from business users to experienced professional developers to build advanced apps.

The [free online training materials](https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/home) that Mendix provides is built in a modular fashion. This means that you can skip modules depending on your knowledge, or only complete the knowledge checks to see if you need more information about a specific topic.

In addition to Mendix being free to try and evaluate, the Mendix Community Edition gives all users unlimited access to the platform and community environments. see the section [Can I Evaluate Mendix Before I Buy?](#evaluate-before) for more details, and then check out section [5.3 How Do I Create an App?](../app-capabilities/web-apps) when you are ready to create your first app with Mendix.

### 3.1 How Does Mendix Onboard New Users? {#tailored-guidance}

Visual development is fast and easy to understand for all type of users, which means that Mendix onboards users with different knowledge levels and goals on the platform. During the signup, users have the option to share their preferences and goals for using the platform. Based on that information, Mendix tailors the guided product introduction tour to their preferences while providing other help methods, links to our online [Mendix Academy](https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/path) material, supplementary content, and suggestions for your next steps. This guidance helps users to understand and navigate the extensive and powerful Mendix Platform.

### 3.2 Can I Evaluate Mendix Before I Buy? {#evaluate-before}

No problem! Anyone can [sign up](https://signup.mendix.com/link/signup/?source=techevaluationguide) on the Mendix Platform. This will create a Mendix account for you, and you will have access to the Mendix Community Edition. The Community Edition is free, meaning no credit card is required, and there are no setup fees.

#### 3.2.1 What Does the Community Edition Offer?

The Mendix Community Edition includes everything you need to design, build, and deploy demos, prototypes, or small applications. All the features in the Mendix IDEs are available without restriction. This edition includes a deployment environment for each application to the Mendix Cloud for up to 10 internal users with no charge.

The Community Edition is designed to provide developers and business users with a rapid cloud deployment option for prototyping and testing new applications, without having to provision a full cloud node.

##### 3.2.1.1 When Should I Upgrade from the Free Edition to a Paid Edition?

The Community Edition is designed for prototyping and testing new applications, and it is not meant as a professional testing or production environment. The cloud environment of the Community Edition is called a Sandbox environment, where you can test the full capabilities of the platform. Due the restrictions on limited users, the lower CPU, and the fact that the app goes into sleep mode after a longer period with no activity, the Community Edition cannot be used for professional app development projects.

When you start a professional app development project, you need more enterprise-level features and services (for example, more deployment options or formal service-level agreements). In that case you need to upgrade your app to a paid cloud environment. Upgrading is easy, as you will keep your user account and all the apps that you have already built.

##### 3.2.1.2 What’s the Definition of an Application? How Big Can It Be?

The short answer is, you decide, there are no limitations. You need to focus on the business need without having to work around artificial limitations to make your app fit into a licensing model or risk big upcharges. At Mendix, you do not have any of these limitations. Technically, an “app” is the complete application as it is set up and organized in the Mendix Platform. It can contain any combination of screens, database entities, processes, and functional components. You will determine the size of an application based on your use case and desired user experience, as well as the app design, model complexity, and maintenance considerations.

It is important to note that the architecture of your app is very important. Speed and flexibility typically drop when an application becomes too big or complex. The Mendix [Application Quality Monitor](../app-lifecycle/model-consistency#aqm) provides insight on  the right granularity of apps and microservices.

##### 3.2.1.3 How Many Applications Can I Build and Deploy?

There is no limitation to the number or the complexity of applications you can build and deploy using the platform when you select the Mendix Community, Pro, or Enterprise Platform Editions.

### 4.3 What Are the Mendix Training Options? {#options}

The Mendix Academy is integrated into the platform and provides both classroom and online training options.
